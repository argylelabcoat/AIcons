These are large scale tile patterns which are commonly used as background
patterns for various uses. This directory has been split into a number
of subsections basied on basic useage. Note however that a background
in on section could easily be used for other purposes. <P>

A C-Preprocessed list of X Window commands to pick a background pattern
from (usally via some `random line picker' program) is available in
"<A HREF="../../support/xbgnd_cmds.cpp" >support/xbgnd_cmds.cpp</A>".
This file also lists some example color settings for bitmaps backgrounds
and small scale patterns. <P>

<TD>   These are background which due to the heavy use of color and detail
       are only really usable as a background for Window Displays. That is
       to say text would not be easily readable (in general) on these
       backgrounds.
<P>
<TR VALIGN=top><TD><A HREF="light/Icons.html">
    Light</A>
<TD>   Light Colored Backgrounds suitable for text documents using a dark
       colored font. This is very important so that a good contrast with
       text and other overwritten details. can be achieved.  These are
       expecially good for use on the WWW. For example paper and wood
       textures.
<P>
<TR VALIGN=top><TD><A HREF="medium/Icons.html">
    Medium</A>
<TD>   Medium colored Backgrounds (Grey?) Backgrounds suitable for
       both a very light and very dark font at the same time. Usually
       some specific color is used for the image. EG: Grey for chitz
       and blue for denim.
<P>
<TR VALIGN=top><TD><A HREF="dark/Icons.html">
    Dark</A>
<TD>   Dark colored Backgrounds for documents with light colored detail.
       For example a starfield of starts on a black background.
<P>
<TR VALIGN=top><TD><A HREF="display/Icons.html">
    Clouds</A>
<TD>   Clouds and various other sky backgrounds which I specifically collected
       to find one I wanted to use on my hobby web pages on "kite flying".
       They are generally very light in color.
<P>
<TR VALIGN=top><TD><A HREF="textures/Icons.html">
    Textures</A>
<TD>   A small sub-set of the copyright (with permission) Macintosh DeskTop
       Textures which were specifically contributed to this library. That
       is that are the best of the set accourding to the users.
