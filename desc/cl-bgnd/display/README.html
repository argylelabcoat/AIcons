   Background Patterns for Desktop Displays

<BR CLEAR=all></NOBR></H1>

<!-- Navagation START -->

These are large scale tile patterns which are commonly used on the root
window as a display background. They are not particularly suitable for
background textures of Documents, though many of those can also be used
window display backgrounds. <P>

These images up until the version 1.6 release of the library were in the
GIF image format.  This was changed to X pixmap with the introduction of X
Pixmap capabilities in the "xv" and "xloadimage" X window clients. <P>

WARNING, while many of these icons do follow the libraries standard color
table, not all of them do. Those that don't generally only use a handful
of colors and as such is unlikely to cause too many problems. <P>

A C-Preprocessed list of X Window commands to pick a background pattern
from (usally via some `random line picker' program) is available in
"<A HREF="../../../support/xbgnd_cmds.cpp" >support/xbgnd_cmds.cpp</A>".
This file also lists some example color settings for bitmaps backgrounds
and small scale patterns. <P>
