     De-archiving ZGip'ed Tar Archives on PCs
 </H1>
<BR CLEAR=all></NOBR>

All the Archives in "Anthony's Icon Library" and "Anthonys WWW Images"
are in the GZip Tar archive format. This format is the accepted archiving
format on FTP and WWW sites for Main frame users. <P>

<B>Why?</B> well the reasons are complex but to put it simply...<BR>
GZip Tar Archives are <FONT SIZE=-1><B>smaller</B></FONT>. <P>

For the complex reasons why this is so I refer you to

>GZip Tar - vs - Zip, Archives</A>". <P>

Linux running on a PC with huge 1600x120 pixel display. <P>

PC users can still de-archive the "Gzip'ed Tar" (.tar.gz or .tgz
suffixes) by using the following archive programs, or getting the source
to both the GZip compression program and a Tar Archive Program from...
<MENU>

<LI>The PC Windows Shareware program "<A
    HREF="http://www.winzip.com/winzip/" >WinZip</A>" can also de-archive
    GZip'ed Tar files as well as the normal PC Zip Archives. <P>
    
    NOTE: The file downloaded is xxxx.tar.gz but the pc saves it as
    xxxx.tar, which winzip can't handle.  It must be renamed to xxxx.gz and
    opened in winzip. Then winzip will ask for the actual name of the file
    archived within, and will recognize the begining part of the file name.
    Then, all one must do is tack on .tar and winzip can then open the
    archive. <P>

<LI>The program source for "GZip" (a compression program, <I>not</I> an
    archiver) and a unix tar archiver "GTar" is available in the gnu
    source area on your nearest major FTP site (Such as 
    <A HREF="ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/">Washington Uni FTP Archive</A><P>

<LI>PC users can find both
    <A HREF="ftp://ftp.coast.net/SimTel/msdos/compress/gzip124.zip">GZip</A>
    and a Tar archive extractor
    <A HREF="ftp://ftp.coast.net/SimTel/msdos/archiver/detar11.zip">DeTar</A>
    or even a full tar archiver
    <A HREF="ftp://ftp.coast.net/SimTel/msdos/archiver/tar320c-.zip">Tar</A>
    binaries from the SimTel PC archive mirrors on all the major ftp sites
    around the world (look under msdos, or simtel sub-directories). <P>

<LI>OS/2 Users can use,
    <A HREF="ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/unix/gtar245.zip">GTar</A> and 
    <A HREF="ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/unix/gzip124.zip">GZip</A> from the
    <A HREF="ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/unix/">hobbes FTP archive</A>. <P>
