   File Symbols for Directory Listings (Bitmaps)

<BR CLEAR=all></NOBR></H1>

<!-- Navagation START -->

<!-- Navagation END -->

This directory contains a set of bitmap file symbols which can be used by
applications for directory listings either directly or programmed in. My
own program called "xbmbrowser" for example uses some of the Bitmap
symbols to display non-image files it finds.
<P>

All the symbols in this directory are 20x20 pixels in size making them
ideal for file listings and menus.
<P>

These symbols can be used directly by the NCSA httpd (WWW server). In fact
this directory was started by this symbol set.   Look at the support file
"HTTPD.srm.conf" on the configuration options which needs to be set.  It
is suggested that any such symbol set be converted to GIF format before
use however though most browsers do understand the X Bitmap.

<DD> A small collection of file symbols for use in creating index files.
     These symbols are particularly useful for client and server programs
     requiring the display of these indexes or to show directory listings.
     Examples   Gopher and FTP Clients,  or  WWW servers.

<DD> An expansion of the appl/desktop/file icon symbols. He has released
     to the network in a shar file. He has also developed color versions
     which was used to start color file symbols section in this library.
