<B>WARNING:</B> I am no longer offically releasing my Icon Library. When I
first created and made it available their was little in the way of good
small image libraries. That has now changed with hundreds of private, free and
comercial libraries available on the net. As such I am bowing out. <P>

Having said that, I will continue to make the occasional addition for my own
use, and the library will continue to be online as long as I have a web page
to export it to. Also My WWW Images (see link below) remain extremly popular
as a image starter for web servers. <P>

Enjoy -- Anthony Thyssen,  November 2002<P>

<B>WWW Users please note...</B> AIcons is a library developed for X Window
users and programmers. As such the format of the icons is X Bitmaps
(monochrome) and X Pixmaps (color).  <I>However,</I> a special sub-section of
this library, "www" (with X bitmaps and pixmaps), is the source for a
separate smalled library "Anthony's WWW Images"... <P>

    To use these icon images it is recomended that you use the converted
    library "<A HREF="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/images/Images.html"

    mirrors, on a few of which is listed in " <A

<H2>Blurb about Anthony's Icon Library</H2>

This collection was developed from the need for a collection of small bitmaps
for both programming and X application icons for use of user displays.  The
library is, in general, free for use, however some authors of icons have some
restrictions and/or copyrights, check the "README" files in the section you
found the icon in.  I would appreciate any new icons you may like to add to
this collection and can be e-mail'ed to me on, &lt;<A
HREF="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/mail.shtml" TARGET="_top"
><B>anthony@cit.gu.edu.au</B></A>&gt;. <P>

A Mailing list is now available for discussions about this library.  To
Subscribe mail the line "subscribe aicons" to 
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:majordomo@cit.gu.edu.au" TARGET="_top"
>majordomo@cit.gu.edu.au</A>&gt;. <P>

For UNIX and X Window browsers of this library I recommend that you
download the <A HREF="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/software.html"
><B>XbmBrowser</B></A> program (for X Windows) to view the un-tar'ed
contents of the AIcons library. Of course the new HTML indexing files can
also be used though it is not as versatile as the XbmBrowser program.  This
library would NOT have been possible to create or maintain without the use
of this program. <P>

Icons are very difficult to group in a logical way. The organization
represents my own attempt at this near impossible task.  Please mail me
with any comments or suggestions you may have or your own contributions to
this library. <P>
