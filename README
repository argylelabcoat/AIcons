Anthony's Icon Library (version 2.0)
  This is a large collection of X window Icons for general use by the X
community and WWW Servers.  Few icon libraries are devoted to the X Window
System and this is the reason this library was started in 1991.

The icon images found inside this collection are small (generally less
than 100 by 100 pixel across) images that can be used for

        * Program icons for general use by window managers
        * Buttons / Widgets / Gadgets  in X window programs
        * Document types for a desktop program (like xdtm)
        * World Wide Web; buttons, indicators, lines, etc.
        * walls, landscapes, space ships, and other objects for games

This collection does NOT contain any `large' pictures, though smaller root
window tile patterns are present. Nor does it contain `junky' icon images
you often find in other libraries. It is also NOT a library of clipart.

Mirrors coordinators of the library are placed on another internal mailing
list to recieve announcements about two weeks before the main announcement
so that the mirrors can be upgraded.

ORGANIZATION

The library's organization is basically by intended usage.
The icons are stored into 4 major categories,

     desc     General descriptive icons for general use. (icons)
     appl     Icons for use within specific applications.
     prog     Icons for programming and other purposes.
     www      Source Images for  ``Anthony's WWW Images''
     large    Icons which are too large for the library (but included anyway).

And a couple of minor categories
     docs          General information files.
     support       A collection of support scripts, config files, etc...
     www_images    Supporting images for HTML files of the library


MAJOR CHANGES

1/
    Thanks to the continued development on the World Wide Web, a real
  flood of icons have become available, usually one or two icons from
  numerous sites around the globe. All icons downloaded are re-colored to
  fit the standard color table used by the library and probably edited a
  small amount.

    As part of this the WWW area is now forming its own major section of the
  library. This whole section is converted to GIF image format and forms

    Anthony's WWW Images  (GIF format)
        http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/images/Images.html
    Download of WWW Images
        http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/images/Archives/WWW_Images.tar.gz
    Just the Button Images of this set
        http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/images/Archives/WWW_Images_Buttons.tar.gz

  Note, that in the AIcons library itself this section is in the source
  X Window image formats, mostly X Pixmap image format, and as such are
  not directly usable by Web users.

2/
  The other major change is that I am now using a program called ``gifmap''
  which creates imagemaped index files of all the images in the library
  for perusal by Web users.

  As part of this process the `list_icons' program has been depreciated
  and is no longer used by the collection.

3/
  The ``desc/cl-32'' icon section containing icons of the same size as used
  on PC Computers and Macintosh Computers, has as been sub-catagorised
  due to the huge number of images in this section.

4/
  The ``desc/cl-bgnd'' section of the library has also been re-organised
  into sub-directories to group background tiles which are suitable
  for backgrounds of documents (like those of the WWW) or those which
  only work as root window backgrounds on Windowed Displays.



PROGRAMS TO USE WITH THIS LIBRARY

The following programs and packages are recommended by me to make this
icon library more enjoyable.

  X Pixmap Library   ftp://koala.inria.fr/pub/xpm
  XbmBrowser 5.1     ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/xbmbrowser5.1.tar.gz
  PbmPlus (netpbm)   ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/netpbm-1mar1994.p1.tar.gz
  CTwm               ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/window_managers/ctwm-3.3.tar.Z
  Xv 3.10a           ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/xv
  Xv Xpm Patch       ftp://koala.inria.fr/pub/xpm/xvxpm.c
  XLoadImage         ftp://ftp.x.org/R5contrib/xloadimage.4.1.tar.gz
  GifMap             (Still in beta testing)

NOTE: The XbmBrowser (UNIX X Windows program) is a must for viewing the
AIcons library as a whole.  Without this program this library would
probably just not exist.

I am also eagerly awaiting the arrival of the official PbmPlus package
from Jef Poskanzer. But with the time he is taking (nearly three years now)
I am not holding my breath.

Thanks for your Attention.
