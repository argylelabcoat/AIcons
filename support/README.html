<H2>Support Files</H2>
This directory to provide support scripts, examples and configuration
file for the use of the Icon Library. This section is highly dependent
on contributions of the users of the library. Please contribute.  <P>

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="scripts/Icons.html">
    <B>Scripts.</B></A>
<DD>Numerous shell and perl scripts I use in managing this icon
    library.  About half of the scripts assume that Jef Poskanzer's
    PbmPlus (or NetPbm) Filter Package is in the users path. I make no
    guarantee on these scripts, though I use them almost everyday.  <P>

    The latest scripts, such as those used to generate GIF animations
    are now using the larger image filter package ImageMagick. <P>

<DT><A HREF="gifmap/Icons.html">
    <B>Gifmap Index Generator</B></A>
<DD>This directory contains the perl script "gifmap" which is used to
    generate the framed indexs thoughout this library, in particular the
    Example Image Pages of the icons that is present within. <P>

    Major thanks goes to <B>Bob Friesenhahn</B> &lt;<A
    HREF="mailto:bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us" >bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us</A
    >&gt; for this marvalious program and putting up with my hundreds of
    suggestions and additions to make this program interface well with this
    library. <P>

<DT><A HREF="configs/">
    <B>Configuration Examples.</B></A>
<DD>Various configuration files (or segments of), to configure specific
    application programs to use sections of the library. May of these
    were donated to this section to help others trying the same thing.  <P>

<DT><A HREF="color-ad/">
    <B>Color Resource File Examples.</B></A>
<DD>Various Resources to force programs to use the standard color table.
    Some applications available suffer from the "Angry Fruit Salad"
    Syndrome, and as such use just about any color that the developer
    can get a hold of. Others just do not provide any usable color
    settings (For example the "Bitmap" program in the X windows
    core).  <P>

    These files are attempts to create color application default files
    for these applications using the standard color table.  <P>

<DT><B>---oOo---  Misc Items  ---oOo---</B><P>

<DT><A HREF="images_mirror"><B>"images_mirror"</B></A> 
<DD> A simple script to download and un-tar the 
      "<A HREF="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/images/Images.html">
      Pre-Converted WWW Images </A>" from this library. The shell script
      uses the lynx program to grab the Gzipped Tar file of these
      images.  <P>

<DT><A HREF="xbgnd_cmds.cpp"><B>"xbgnd_cmds.cpp"</B></A>
<DD>This is a  file which will generate a list of all commands producing
    "good" background display patterns to be found in this library.
    Lots more such images are also contained within this file which have
    been commented out as being not suitable. <P>

    The file is filtered with the `C Pre-Processor' to allow it to be
    more compact and for easy modification of the X commands used to set
    your displays background.  Look at the comments at the top of the
    file for more information on using it.  <P>

    You may also like to download the <A HREF="scripts/randomline">
    randomline</A> perl script to randomly pick a image from this file.
    <P>

    Suggestions for alternative colors for bitmap backgrounds are most
    welcome.  <P>

<DT><B>Patch for XV 3.10a</B>
<DD> The XV 3.10a program has a bad X pixmap handling module.
     You can fix this by substituting this replacement
     <A HREF="ftp://koala.inria.fr/xpm/xvxpm.c">"xvxpm.c"</A> module I
     created from an older version of XV. For more information please
     read the <A HREF="ftp://koala.inria.fr/xpm/xvxpm.README">README</A>
     file.  <P>
