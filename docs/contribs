                       Anthony's X Icon Library
                     ----------------------------
                  Contributors and Authorship of Icons
               ------------------------------------------

  Note, due to the difficulty in keeping comments details inside icons
when processing them (especially in changing to and from the PbmPlus
processing programs), authorship and contribution details for icons are
listed in this file.  To correct any errors, additions, changes to this
file please mail me.

  My own contributions and creations include (many scanned and edited)
  the following icons in the ``desc/std'' area :-
    aborigine, atom, axe, ballet, calculator, catoblepus, dancer,
    dinosaurs_[1-6], dragon, eagle, eagle2, eyeball, garfield, go,
    (new)harpie, kraken, kurango, leonardo, lyrch, mandarin, network,
    nude, oracle, shawnee, shuttle, shuttle2, sisyphus, (new)sphinx, swan,
    syclla, triangle, vampire, witch.
  I will not bother listing my own contributions in other areas, though 
  they are many.
    NOTE: I do often `cleanup' incoming icons to a small extent, "thing"
  mail icon being a good example. All the color icons have been also
  recolored so that all the xpm color icons share the same colortable of
  about 30 colors.

  Armaghan Hoveydai <armaghan@cit.gu.edu.au> -- System Administrator
     for the original icons that started this collection. These include in
     the `std' area :-
        citadel, citadelroot, cornet, gucis, gucisroot, siren,
        (the original) sphinx & harpie and   desc/bw-64/thorax.xbm.

  Ashley Roll <aroll@dstc.edu.au>
     the excellent xbmbrowser program - a must for looking through this
     icon library, or any icon collection.  and a number of icons in the
     std section.  The browser is what made this library a practical
     reality.

  Staff and Students of Griffith University
     For their many creations and discoveries. Special thanks to
        Ashley Roll <aroll@dstc.edu.au>
        Corey Venour <cvenour@cit.gu.edu.au>
        David Connors <dconnors@cit.gu.edu.au>     

  Steve Kinzler <kinzler@cs.indiana.edu>
     Steve has made an enormous number of contributions to this library
     in the 48x48 pixel sizes. These include.
       * Most of all the black and white 48x48 icons ``desc/bw-48'',
       * A collection of monochrome 48x48  "Flags of the World"
         ``desc/bw-48/Flags''
       * The above set of flags colored in the libraries colors
         ``desc/cl-48/Flags''
       * A set of Olympic sports symbols from the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics
         ``desc/bw-48/Olympic''
       * A standard sized camel (from my wants list)  ``desc/std/camel.xbm''
     Most of the above icons are actually part of his own `faces' bitmap
     collection which is now known as picons. This library is too large
     and dynamic to be included completely into this library, and is
     basically designed for a different purpose. You can always download
     the most recent of these collections from
	  http://www.cs.indiana.edu/picons/ftp/index.html
	  ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/faces/picons
     They include hundreds of logos for Internet domains and Usenet
     newsgroups and thousands of faces of users.

  Jef Poskanzer
     the Poskanzer Bitmap Collection and the original pbmplus image
     converters. After re-discovering the original location of the
     collection I have included a set of playing cards from his collection
     (section "appl/cards/" ).  This collection can be found
         ftp.ee.lbl.gov : /poskbitmaps/
     See the main README file for the latest PbmPlus filter release ftp site.

  Oliver Trepte  <oliver@fysik4.kth.se>  (http://www.fysik4.kth.se/~oliver)
     The adminsitrator for the NetPbm package, an update to Jef Poskanzer's
     PBMPlus filter set. See the main README for lastest release.

  Geoff Adams <gadams@avernus.com>   and
  Stephen Krauth <phred@avernus.com>
     Geoff has kindly allowed the inclusion of some of his ``Desktop
     Textures'' into the library. These colourful background patterns can
     be found in the sub-section ``desc/cl-bgnd/Textures''. The textures
     are 128x128 color background images which are a bit large for this
     collection but the ones included in the collection are ones various
     users have contributed.
       NOTE: these images are copyright and can not be included into any
     package without first contacting Geoff before hand.  He has provided
     a copyright notice which is included in that directory. The full
     ``Desktop Textures'' can be downloaded from
	     ftp.eng.umd.edu : /pub/avernus

  Simon Marlow  <simonm@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk>   and
  Albert Graef  <ag@muwiinfa.geschichte.uni-mainz.de>
    A number of icons and ideas for icons from their X File Manager (xfm)
    program. Almost all the icons take have since been heavy modified.

  Edward Groenendaal <eddyg@cogs.sussex.ac.uk>  and
  Ramon Santiago  <rjs@pencom.com>  and
  Lionel Mallet  <Lionel.Mallet@sophia.inria.fr>
     The authors of X Desktop Manager another file manager program for X
     windows. A number of icons and ideas for icons in
     ``appl/desktop/docs''.

  XPaint Source -- David Koblas <koblas@netcom.com>
     Some drawing icons ``prog/drawing'' from his excellent xpaint
     program.  I have returned some additions/changes back to him for
     inclusion into the next release.

  Crossfire Bitmaps
     for the 24x24 `planview' adventure icons throught the prog sections.

  XTrek font
    for the initial set of various `rotated' space ships, see prog/space
    Author unknown.

  Claude Lecommandeur <Claude.Lecommandeur@epfl.ch>   and
  Ion Cionca <Ion.Cionca@epfl.ch>
     The initial set of cl-misc icons in the ctwm (Claude Tab Window
     Manager) sources. These required careful recoloring as the original
     colors had no order to them.  The icon ``desc/cl-64x38/claude.xpm'',
     is I assume a icon of the author.  Some of these were donated to ctwm
     by Ion Cionca. (See mail README file for ftp site)
       This sub-collection of icons -- converted to the standard color
     table now form a new separate icon section of the library.
     ``desc/cl-64x38''

  Dan Reynolds <dan@chpc.utexas.edu>
     Contributed some more xpm icons of the same odd size (64x38) as
     Claude Lecommandeur above. The icons contributed have been added to
     cl-64x38 are: term_convex.xpm, term_cray.xpm, term_ibm.xpm,
     term_sun.xpm, clock.xpm, and x.xpm.

  Rene (Kiwi) Mueller <kiwi@iis.ethz.ch>    (http://err.ethz.ch/~kiwi)
     An extremely large contribution of 32x32 color icons. Most of these
     were also converted for use in the B/W 32x32 collection. These icons
     obviously came from a collection old msdos icons.
       Rene also contributed a couple of Gif files containing a set of
     three dimensional icons, presumably from an amiga. These icons have
     been heavily edited to create the section ``appl/desktop/3d''. I have
     done a lot of work on this set, particularly to add the X pixmap
     transparent color into the icons.  NOTE: I have NOT finished sorting
     this set.

  Mark Rawling <Mark.Rawling@mel.dit.csiro.au>
     A few self made icons from a comic strip: gary, robotman and spacecop
     in both ``desc/bw-64'' and ``desc/cl-64'' sections.

     ribbon, and tabby.

     main README file on where you can ftp this library from.

     from this collection.

  Bill Morris  <bmorris@borg24.jsc.nasa.gov>
      Bill managed to solve one of my icon `wants' with his reference to
    NASA WWW servers, which allowed me to create "desc/std/shuttle.xbm"

  World-Wide-Web Sites around the world.
    I have collected numerous icons from WWW sites (usually only a couple
    from each site). This is a collective thanks to all these sites
