<!-- Navagation END -->

This section has been divided into sub-directories each containing one
basic type or style of wall or fence which can be put together. Mazes
and castle walls are very east to produce from these icons.<P>

The letter or number following the descriptive name is the Hexadecimal
code of the way that icon fits in the overall picture.  Bit 0 (lowest bit)
is up and then it follows clockwise order. For Example :-<P>
<PRE>
                          1 (bit 0)
                              |
                  8 (bit 3) --+-- 2 (bit 1)
                              |
                          4 (bit 2)
</PRE>

So a south eastern corner piece (with walls in direction up and left)
has a hex code of 
<BLOCKQUOTE>up + left  ==>  bits 0 & 3  ==>  1 + 8  ==>  tile 9</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Note that many walls have `extra' things provided, for example the castle
and town wall set also has images for wall breaks and gate houses.<P>

Many of the walls in the sub-directories are 24x24 bits are from the unix
graphic adventure game `crossfire'. However other walls also exist, for
example the walls from `sokoban' can also be found here.<P>
