This was the original (historical) directory of the icons library when it
was first created (1990). The library was created to hold other icons which
could be used to generate other 64x54 bitmap icons.  <P>

The size 64x54 was agreed on by the system programmers here are Griffith
University, Faculity of Science and Technology, as an appropriate size for
icons. It is close to a "golden rectangle" in proportion (IE it is
pleasing to the eye) and when a icon name is attached by the window manager
it generally become another "golden rectangle" (vectically this time).
It was also close to the 64x64 size which was in common use when sunview
windows were prevalent only a few years before this.  <P>

Due to these origins, some of the icons have machine names instead of
descriptive names as elsewhere in the collection.  For example the icon
"kurango.xbm" is the name of one of our big Sun Sparc Servers, and is
Australian Aboriginal for `Sun'. The icon should probably be called
`ayres_roock.xbm' or something like that.  "gucis.xbm" is another such
machine name in this section.  <P>

The README files "xrdb", "twm" and "using", in the "docs" section of the
library, contains information to make use of these icons in a typical X
windows environment. Another READMEs file, "using", is a particular example
of using a particular icon for a specific query that was made to me.  <P>
