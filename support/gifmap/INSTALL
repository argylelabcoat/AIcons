The following are notes to help you install gifmap.

If you are installing gifmap for global use, edit the definitions of
$opt_prefixpath, $opt_rootpath, $opt_iconpath, $opt_htimage, and
$opt_maptype in the gifmap script as described in the manual page.

If you are installing gifmap for personal use, place definitions for these
variables in the $HOME/.gifmaprc file rather than editing the script. This
will make it easier to update to new versions of the program.

			  Path Configuration
			  ==================

The following .gifmaprc file path variables will configure gifmap for a Web
server root of "/html" and gifmap icon path "/html/Images/gifmap".

$opt_prefixpath = '';		# Path or URL to prepend to root URL
				# Not used if local relative paths used
$opt_rootpath   = '/html';      # Directory Path to top of html tree
				# Needed to determine relative paths to images
$opt_iconpath   = 'Images/gifmap';
				# Relative path under rootpath / prefixpath

Or, if your images and icons are under your personal HTML directory (e.g.
http://www.bogus.com/~bfriesen/) which is physically "/home/bfriesen/html"
and the gifmap icons are in "/home/bfriesen/html/icons/gifmap", you can use
the configuration:

$opt_prefixpath = '/~bfriesen'; # Path or URL to prepend to root URL
				# Not used if local relative paths used
$opt_rootpath   = '/home/bfriesen/html'; # Directory Path to top of html tree
				# Needed to determine relative paths to images
$opt_iconpath   = 'icons/gifmap';
				# Relative path under rootpath / prefixpath

			Server Side Imagemaps
			=====================

In order for server-side imagemaps (used by older browsers) to work
properly, some configuration may be required. The default configuration is
for the original CERN server as follows:

# Server-side imagemap settings
$opt_htimage='/cgi-bin/htimage'; # Base URL to server-side imagemap CGI
			# On some systems this is /cgi-bin/imagemap
			# Set to '' to use a ".map" URL with
			# relative URLs (latest NCSA & Apache)
$opt_maptype='cern';	# Maptype must be "cern" or "ncsa". If
			# you are using Apache, specify "ncsa".
			# Case *is* significant


If you are using a recent NCSA or Apache server that supports server-side
imagemaps using relative URLs, then you can use values similar to the
following:

# Server-side imagemap settings
$opt_htimage='';	# Base URL to server-side imagemap CGI
			# On some systems this is /cgi-bin/imagemap
			# Set to '' to use a ".map" URL with
			# relative URLs (latest NCSA & Apache)
$opt_maptype='ncsa';	# Maptype must be "cern" or "ncsa". If
			# you are using Apache, specify "ncsa".
			# Case *is* significant


			     INSTALLATION
			     ============

If you would like an automated installation, execute the provided configure
script specifying a --prefix option for a GNU-style directory heriarchy you
would like to install in (e.g. "./configure --prefix=/opt/tools"). Then
"make install". This will install gifmap and its manual page. The #! line
will be edited to reflect the location of your PERL interpreter. The gifmap
icons will *not* be automatically installed. You must copy these into place
by hand. The only requirement is that they share the same directory
somewhere under the same server "root" as the images you want to catalogue.

Please be careful than when running gifmap you are in the correct directory.
If you are in the wrong directory (such as in the server's root),
you can do serious damage because gifmap will overwrite all your
HTML index files. To ensure that gifmap never generates HTML index
files in a particular directory you can create a ".gifmaprc" file
in that directory with the line:
    $opt_ignore = 1;  # ignore this directory (though link it in)

If no sub-directories are to be have gifmap applied (if run with
the option ``-recurse'') you can also add the line:
     $opt_prune = 1;  # prune all sub-directories for recursive runs

If you encounter any difficulties, have suggestions, or accolades, feel
free to send gifmap's author (Bob Friesenhahn, bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us)
an email.
