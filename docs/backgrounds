| Hi Anthony,
|
| I came here looking for some interesting patterns

| Can you offer any assistance?

Have a look in my icon library

   Anthonys Icons
      http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/

Or more specifically

   Color Background Images (descriptive)
      http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/desc/cl-bgnd    
 
This directory contains a number of X pixmap backgrounds patterns   
Also in this directory are two sub-directories of GIF images

   Textures  -- a partial set of the ``DeskTop Textures package''
                This is free to use an any machines except PC's
                and if the copyright notices are left with the images.

   Netscape  -- The background gif images from netscape communications
                I am currently trying to get express permission but they
                released it to the world so I slurped it up.
    
The last is also included in the www section under the sub-directory BGnds

You may also like to look in

   Greyscale backgrounds
     http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/desc/gr-bgnd
   Bitmap Background Images
     http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/desc/bw-bgnd

The README file in the bitmap area has a number of color suggestions
for when you use of convert the bitmaps. Bitmaps do not have any colors
associated with them by default.

Similarly you can look at bitmap patterns.. (low scale textures)

   Patterns and Textures
      http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/prog/patterns

and pick appropriate colors for display.

A full list of Icon patterns and collors can be found in
