In this directory is the gifmap program which is used to generate the
example index pages for Web Users of the AIcons Library. 
The gifmap program was written by <B>Bob Friesenhahn</B>
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us"
>bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us</A >&gt; with consultation with myself. <P>

The latest version of the program can be downloaded from

The only change I make to this source is to set the location of the
"$global_option_file" to point to the "<A HREF="gifmaprc">gifmaprc</A>"
file in this directory. <P>


<H3>README from Gifmap sources</H3>

Gifmap provides a means of easily putting image collections on the Web.
It recurses through directory trees, building HTML pages and imagemap
(GIF or JPEG) files to allow the user to navigate through collections of
thumbnail images (somewhat similar to 'xv') and select the images to
view with a mouse click.<P>

Gifmap is highly configurable. Its goal is to provide lots of options
while doing a nice job out of the box. Configuration may be done from
the command line, or via .gifmaprc files which effect the overall
installation, or images in a directory tree.<P>

Gifmap is optimized to use the features of the latest Web browsers,
however, less capable browsers like NCSA Mosaic and Lynx have not been
forgotten.<P>

Read the INSTALL file to get started with installation of gifmap. Read
gifmap.txt or the manual page for the details on how to use gifmap. A
key installation requirement is that you must first install the
ImageMagick image manipulation toolset.<P>

Gifmap is written by Bob Friesenhahn (bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us). I
would be happy to hear about your trials and tribulations with gifmap.<P>
