Most of the icons are from 24x24 tiles used for the network UNIX game <A
HREF="http://www.cm.cf.ac.uk/Crossfire/">Crossfire</A>.  Some of these
however have been colored by myself and are now used thoughout the world
on the world wide web. A fully colored set of pixmaps are also
available.<P>

NOTE: as buildings are large most of these are build using multple 24
pixel tiles, as such there size varies. <P>
