In the sub-directories are found objects and items which could be
encoundered in plan view adventures or many sorts. They are presented
here as a source for descriptive icons to create and use. <P>

NOTE: Some of the objects could be carried by and adventurer in a game,
others are just found or present in a planview map as `decoration'.
Other items are `transport' which could be entered by adventurers to go
from place to place. These later do not class as `ships' in this
collection as they are just an image without any `direction'. <P>
