DESKTOP TEXTURES COPYRIGHT

Desktop Textures is an on-going graphic arts/software project of Stephen
Krauth and Geoff Adams, one of several such projects at Avernus.  The xpm
files in this directory are derived from the textures we've created for
display on the Macintosh desktop.

You can find out more from   http://www.avernus.com/desktop-textures/

Their use is generally encouraged, but redistribution then in any form
(such as using a texture as a basis or background for another work),
requires that you credit Stephen Krauth and Geoff Adams of Avernus with the
creation of the texture(s) you use. Obtain our permission prior to
redistribution in any form other than as the complete Desktop Textures
package (including all textures, programs, and READMEs) or as a part of a
World-Wide Web page.
