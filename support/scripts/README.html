Numerous shell and perl scripts I use in managing this icon library.
About half of the scripts assume that Jef Poskanzer's PbmPlus (or
NetPbm) Filter Package is in the users path. I make no guarantee on
these scripts, though I use them almost everyday.  <P>

The latest scripts, such as those used to generate GIF animations are
now using the larger image filter package ImageMagick. <P>

Most of the scripts are also designed to handle both X bitmaps and or X
pixmap images which is from here on referred to as X images. Also all files
work on multiple X image files unless otherwise noted (unlike their PbmPlus
counter parts).  <P>

Also many of these scripts understand the X pixmap transparent color and
preserves it while filtering the icon through the PbmPlus filters, which
does not understand transparency. The big exception to this is
the recolor script which I hope to convert from using pbmplus to
imagemagick commands so it will preserve the transparency. <P>

To find where these software packages are, look in the <A
HREF="../../software.html">software index files</A> from the AIcons Web
page.<P>

As these are scripts, the usage and any documentation for the command is
given as comments at the start of the script files. I try to comment all my
scripts this way. So look at the top of the script for its usage and
purpose.  <P>

You can find a Xbmbrowser Menu Config File which uses these scripts in "<A
HREF="../configs/xbmbrowserrc">support/configs/xbmbrowserrc</A>". The
Xbmbrowser program program is a must for viewing and modifying a whole
directory of icons, under X Windows. (See software web page above) <P>

Anything marked as "OLD" means that I have not used that script for
sometime and as such it could be broken and/or behave unexpectedly. Please
check such scripts carefully before use.  <P>
