These icons hold font set images which usually quite fancy and colorful, can
not be used firectly in a black and white font file. That is to say that these
letters are better used from a program or in generating larger pictures.<P>

Many of the number fonts are extremely suitable to generating counters such as
used on the www pages. <P>

<DD>    "bubble_*.xpm" fonts
<DD>   Bubble fonts using only 3 colors, and a white hightlight. The larger
       ones were from his program XMirrorMagic while the smaller ones
       are from "rocks n diamonds".

<DD>    "drippy.xpm" was created from a raw black and white font 
        found on the internet. The font was smoothed, displaced and
        overwritten on the original to produce the desired `dripping'
        font. The primary purpose was for a sign in my web castles
        dungeon (glowing moss on wall).

<DT> Numerous sets of Digits have suddenly appeared for web counters
     (odometers!) Some of these have been placed here as well.  One
      collection of these counter digits is
         http://www.digits.com/charsets.html
