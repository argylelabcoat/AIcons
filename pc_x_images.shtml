     Converting images for PC use
 </H1>
<BR CLEAR=all></NOBR>

The images in Anthony's Icon Library are designed for use on X window
displays. As such the image format used throughout the library is X bitmap
for black and white monochrome images and X pixmap for color images. <P>

PC users however will likely not be able to use these image formats
directly and will need to convert them to a different format.  Below are
some programs I have been told about to allow you to either view and or
convert the X window image formats to something more usable on those
machines. <P>

<B>Disclaimer:</B> I am NOT a Windows user, and never really likes the
restricted enviorment provided by it.  I prefer the more free form environment
of UNIX and X Windows, and now Linux. I use to do my work from a Sun Color
Desktop Workstation, but have now moved to SuSE Linux, then later to Redhat
Linux running on a PC with huge 1600x120 pixel display. <P>

If any of the information provided, is wrong, incorrect, or you would like 
to add another choice, mail me.  Otherwise I do not really want to know
about PCs and their problems. ;-) <P>

<DD>The PC-NT version of one of the image filter packages I use
    in processing this library of images, is able to cobvert almost any image
    format to any other, and much much more.  It has both a command line,
    and GUI interface.  The command line interface makes it especially useful
    for batch processing of images.

<DD>This program is able to convert both Xbm and Xpm formats, although it
    does other things including converting to a wide number of formats.
    The program is DOS but works fine under Windows & Win95. It is fairly
    straight forward to install & use.  <P>

    Very occasionally, I have been told, Display cannot view a file &
    gives error message 'EOF found in header'. This is probably due to
    the free form nature of the X window image format. <P>

    The programs home page dissappeared and the original source archive has
    vanished, as such I can no longer recoment it. <P>

NOTE: Some image converters for PC I use to list have dissappeared from the
web.  While others have been mentioned to me.  I take no responsability for
them.  As I said I am not a windows user, and as such do not use these
particular programs myself. <P>

If you know where these programs can be found, or any other image converters,
please let me know. <P>
