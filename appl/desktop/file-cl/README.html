   File Symbols for Directory Listings (color)

<BR CLEAR=all></NOBR></H1>

<!-- Navagation START -->

<!-- Navagation END -->

This directory contains a set of color file symbols which can be used by
applications for directory listings either directly or programmed in.
<P>

These symbols can be used by the Apatche and the NCSA httpd (WWW
server).  Look at the support file  "<A HREF="HTTPD.srm.conf"
>HTTPD.srm.conf</A>" in this directory. <P>

It is suggested that any such symbol set be converted to GIF format before
use however as most browsers (like netscape) do not understand the X pixmap
format.  (See the <A HREF="../../../support/scripts/xbm2gif">xbm2gif</A>
script) <P>
