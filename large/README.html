This section is NOT strictly part of the AIcons library, the images being
large and not very useful as display icons in any real sense.  The images in
this section are included only as a reference. Bits of these images could be
extracted or scaled for use in smaller icons, or as detail in large window
interfaces.  <P>

Please do not send me pictures which are not similar to the images in
this section as refusal can hurt. Images are better sent to "Poskanzer
Bitmap Collection" (See "<A HREF="../docs/contribs" >docs/contribs</A>"),
or one of the now very common clip-art libraries on the WWW.
