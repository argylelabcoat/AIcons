   "appl/mail"<BR>
   Icons for showing the status of mail (xbiff &amp; xmail progs)

<BR CLEAR=all></NOBR></H1>

<!-- Navagation START -->

<!-- Navagation END -->

Most mail readers and mail status indicator programs only use two
icons for their indication,  no mail, and, new mail.
However some mail programs have three status,  none,   old, and  new,
and as such the icons are groups into those catagories.
<P>

X Pixmaps in this directory may also have the `transparent' color set
for self masking, if the mail application understands this.  <P>

X Bitmap may have a separate `mask' image for the mail programs which
allow their use.<P>


These icons are appended with a specific set of strings.<PRE>
   ___filename_________represents__________________
      *_new.xbm      new mail just arrived.  mail man calling :-)
      *_none.xbm     no mail in mail box OR all mail has been read.
      *_old.xbm      only old mail is in mail box IF given
      *_mask.xbm     for mask bitmap and shaped windows (ie: for xbiff icons)

     The "No Thing" addition however was my own idea which Keith liked.
