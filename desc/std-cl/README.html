   "Standard" Size Color icons for X Windows

<!-- Navagation START -->

With the advent of Color Window managers, a number of the standard sized
64x54 icons have been colored or different color versions created.
As such this directory contains Color Standard sied icons.  <P>

Due to these origins, some of the icons have machine names instead of
descriptive names as elsewhere in the collection.  For example the icon
"kurango.xbm" is the name of one of our big Sun Sparc Servers, and is
Australian Aboriginal for `Sun'. The icon should probably be called
`ayres_roock.xbm' or something like that.  "gucis.xbm" is another such
machine name in this section.  <P>

The README files "xrdb", "twm" and "using", in the "docs" section of the
library, contains information to make use of these icons in a typical X
windows environment.  <P>
